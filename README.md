## Description of The App

The Crime Statistics Dashboard aims to help the user visualise the trend of crime rates in various states of the USA from 1970-2015.

The landing page of the dashboard is designed to have four filters at the left for selecting the states in the US, crime types (Violent, Larceny, Rape and Homicide), year range (1975 to 2015) and the metric used (rate or number). The US map is presented at the top of the dashboard with tooltip at each state to show the crime data related to the selected state. The level of color shading for states would be based on the value of the crime metric. To the right of the US map there will be a treemap plot. The first hierarchy of the treemap plot will show the different types of crimes committed, represented by a rectangle, with its area proportional to its value. Using tooltip, the user can select a particular type of crime, upon which the next hierarchy of the treeplot will be shown wherein that particular crime type is broken down by the different states. At the bottom, there will be a trend-plot showing the crime number/rate over the select years, for the selected states, grouped by different crime types
